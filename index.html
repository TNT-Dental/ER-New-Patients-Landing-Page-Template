              <p>"My family dentist sent me to Dr. McGinnity for two separate root canals.  He did fantastic work on me!  A few years go by and my family dentist retired so I established as a regular patient with Dr. McGinnity.  He does great work, is friendly, was able to numb me, and was quick.  What more could you ask for?  His assistant was awesome and his office staff are so friendly.  He makes you feel at ease and I am blessed to be his patient.  See him for your dental work!  You won't be sorry!!"</p>
