                <p>"This place is great! I had my first visit there yesterday and am happy to call them my new dentist. The dental hygenist (Misty) was very knowledgeable and offered a multitude of tips to keep my teeth in top shape. She was friendly and patient. Doctor Jorgensen and his team are wonderful. Did I mention they have TV's in their office? You can watch anything you want while your teeth are getting cleaned. 10/10 I'm glad I switched to this dental office."</p>
